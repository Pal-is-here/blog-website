    <p>This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.</p>

    <p>To start with are the characters themselves ; their faces are constantly frozen into an expression that you cannot empathise with at all. In the animated film, the capture of the elegance and beauty of all the emotion that Simba experiences with his father until the battle at Pride Rock was poetic and as transparent as day. The pencils of the respected animators could draw in tears, frowns, body language - depression on celluloid. Just like a live-action film, the purity of this emotion is captured in such a way that audiences don’t even need to hear Simba talk. All there is to show is him nuzzling the corpse of the great Mufasa, flooding his eyes without a word.
      For that matter, real animals in the wild truly do have an issue with limited facial range. Just look at a shark or an eagle - they both have frowns for all eternity. Same thing with the lions and the hyenas - there is no emotion in those eyes or their overall look. Without any voice to go with it, there is nothing for the mind to abstract on and create feeling and drama as we look at a motionless face without a tear for Mufasa. And hands down, Zazu is the worst nut job of all ; he has a beak! A beak that does not contort at all like it did in 1994! 
    Why market it as a ‘live action’ film when, in reality, it is still animation, just in a different style? While it is certainly realistic enough, really, it only shows how much money Disney really has. It is not live-action at all. Plus, they even made claims that this movie would have a bloodier ending. Spoilers (or not spoilers), because I say ‘Not!’, because there is nothing special to see! It is all the same! Unlike ‘The Jungle Book’, there are absolutely zero tweaks to the plot, character arcs or, basically anything! Predictable and not self-aware at all! It is just an updated printout of what we have already known for over 25 years now! Disney lied! Twice!
      What is even more disturbing are the realisations that, back in the day, they were only just teaching children not to lie, among other things like individuality, honesty and value in love. But now, having almost everything in the world, they have been corrupted ; money and fame is now the only way to know if you are still good. And with the thought of money comes the dark side of Disney ; their lust for what they hadn’t in the 90s naturally made them feel overshadowed by their own power - they wanted to forget their humble beginnings, and they had been saying that all along since 2014, when ‘Maleficent’ came out.They are truly ashamed of themselves for what they used to be. Ashamed of making us satisfied with so little. And, thus, it has turned them into the villains of their own movies, screwing individuality, honesty and value in love as though it makes them less special than other companies. They have been reduced to producing cheap cutouts instead to preserve our love of them, to remind us that they are still the best and richest, and to keep getting richer. They are lying, they are scheming, they are plotting…and, like high school geeks, they are getting more insecure by the minute, unsure about their current path and where it has led them. And they fear losing our respect. And it prompts them ; they did not gently take Mufasa out to teach children a lesson - they purposely murdered him for wealth. They are Scar!</p>
